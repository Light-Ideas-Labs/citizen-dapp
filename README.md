# Citizen Dapp

Citizen is a Decentralized Application built on top of the Celo Blockchain to track donation /procurement funds as well as NGOs/government projects.

## App download

Check out the latest [Expo build here]() (requires the Expo Go app).

**Note: This app uses testnet cUSD exclusively, and requires a [Celo test wallet](https://celo.org/developers/wallet) in order to work**

## Background info

Celo is a mobile-first blockchain. It is a fork of Ethereum and is built to be a global payments infrastructure targeting the developing world. Celo has two native cryptocurrencies, cUSD (a currency that's pegged to the Dollar, 1 cUSD = 1 USD) and Celo gold (a volatile currency used for Celo governance and utility). Citizen uses cUSD exclusively to transact.

## Theme are you addressing

Transparency in public procurement and the administration of public finances.

## The Problem

Worldwide, governments devote an estimated $9.5 trillion each year to public procurement – an average of approximately 15% of national GDP. This money goes to public goods and services such as the construction of roads and the delivery of healthcare services, but also tends to line the pockets of corrupt government officials, corporate executives and others who are involved in the procurement process. The problem is almost universal.

Both the UN and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimate that 10-30% of a public contract’s overall value is commonly lost to corruption. These numbers have led the World Bank to conclude that “curtailing procurement corruption may represent one of the most effective economic development programs that a country can adopt.”
While the extent of procurement corruption varies from country to country, the causes are common: inadequate record keeping, low public accountability, repeat and close interactions between the private sector and government officials and centrally controlled processes. These combined factors create an opaque, complex and high-value process vulnerable to corruption.

## The Solution

The use of a Blockchain-Based Public Procurement System is the most comprehensive solution for public procurement and for public-sector corruption in general.
It will enable permanent and tamper-evident record keeping, real-time transparency and auditability, and automated “smart contracts.” This will increase uniformity, objectivity and transparency.

For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments began emergency direct contracting to procure necessary health services and supplies. These contracts were and still are particularly at high risk as they are awarded very quickly in the absence of competitive auction. The next-generation electronic procurement systems, including those developed with blockchain, can record direct-contract activity in a permanent, secure and automated manner to potentially reduce corruption risk going forward.

## Why we made Citizen Dapp and it's potential for impact in Kenya and the African continent

Money heist became the trending hashtag after funds donated by world bank and other organizations to fight Covid-19 were misused. This angered many Kenyans.

The project was accelerated by the UNODC Hackathon where Celo was part of the main sponsors and we won on the best implementation category. This has inspired us to work on this project.

We envision that our platform will promote participatory democracy in Africa where citizens can participate in important projects through verification of work done by organizations and earn incentives. We also believe in Celo’s mission; prosperity for all and funds should not be for the elite only. Our project aligns with the SDG Goal 16 – Peace, Justice, Strong Institution.

With the decentralized ledgers it will be more difficult to extract records of bids and public comments, or to alter bid or tender offers once submitted. This will decentralize decision-making, oversight and record-keeping, enhance transparency and devolve power away from authorities who might be prone to corruption.

It will enable vendors and tenderers to conduct the vendor bidding and evaluation processes, while also allowing third parties such as journalists and citizens to monitor and flag risky activity in real time. The software includes several automated features such as minimum bidding and public comment periods and automatic “red flags” to alert potentially corrupt activity.
The blockchain-based procurement will offer governments and procurement entities the potential to de-corrupt their procurement processes.

Our target audience is NGOs, Donors, Procurement Entities and Citizens.

Some ideas for Citizen Dapp include:

- Creating a Project
- Viewing a list of all projects

## Our experience building Cititzen

The first thing we built out was the [smart contracts](https://github.com/Light-Ideas-Labs/citizen-mobile/tree/main/contracts) for Cititzen. The initial smart contract prototype is very short which has brought us to a realization of the cictizen Dapp.

Since we had the smart contract ready, we were able to focus on the Citizen Dapp (this repo!) for the remainder of time we worked on this hackathon project. This was our first time building a React Native app, so there was a learning curve but overall it went a lot quicker than if we would have built native apps.

## Features

Citizen currently supports the following features:

- Users/organization can create, and manage their own Projects.
- Users can view all listed Projects.
- Integration with the Celo Alfajores Wallet to handle payments.

## Running Citizen locally

`git clone https://github.com/Light-Ideas-Labs/citizen-dapp`

cd Citizen-Mobile

`npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps`

`expo start`

``npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps`` is used because running ``npm install`` by itself returns a dependency tree error.
